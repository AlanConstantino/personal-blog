# Personal-blog
This is my personal blog where I talk about coding and web development.

This blog was built using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.

The looks of the blog were inspired by the [Evermore template](https://webflow.com/templates/html/evermore-blog-website-template).

The icons used are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

# Technologies
- Utilized HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
- Also used Bootstrap to make responsive.
