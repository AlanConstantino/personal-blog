          Are you tired of typing long commands into the terminal? Did
          you misremember a flag causing an error making you pull out
          your hair for 2 minutes only to realize that flag doesn't
          exist? Well worry no more because I'll be showing you how to
          create aliases for all of those pesky hard-to-remember
          commands.

        <p>
          Creating your own deepfakes has been possible for a while now
          but the problem was that it required a lot of data, computing
          power, and time. But now, thanks to several AI researchers, we
          are now able to create deepfakes with a single image. Better
          yet, not only can we create deepfakes with a single image, but
          they also don't take hours or days to make, now they take only
          mere onds and at most a couple of minutes.

        <p>
          I suck at taking care of plants, mostly because I forget to
          water them. So then I started thinking, "I'm sure someone out
          there has figured out a way to automate this process." Turns
          out, there are plenty of people who have. Namely in the form
          of using an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi to automatically water
          their plants. In this post, I'll be talking about how I used a
          Raspberry Pi and Python to automatically water my plant.

          How do we keep that pesky footer at the bottom? Well, today
          I'll be showcasing three solutions to this problem. The first
          and simplest solution is using flexbox, the second solution is
          using grid, and the final solution is using a wrapper.
          Alright, let's get started.

          In this article we'll create a Discord bot using Python. The
          bot we'll be creating today will have a simple purpose,
          telling jokes. We will give the bot a command and it will
          return a random joke. This should be simple enough, let's get
          started!
