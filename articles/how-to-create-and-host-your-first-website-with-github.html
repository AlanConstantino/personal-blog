          <hr />

          <p>
            In this article I&#39;ll teach you how to create your very own
            website and host it through GitHub completely for free. Let&#39;s
            get started!
          </p>
          <h2 id="github-setup">GitHub Setup</h2>
          <p>
            Firstly, you&#39;ll need to create a
            <a href="https://github.com/signup">GitHub</a> account if you
            don&#39;t have one already.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once that is complete you&#39;ll want to create a new public
            repository with the following name (case sensitivity doesn&#39;t
            matter):
          </p>
          <pre><code>&lt;your_github_username&gt;.github.io</code></pre>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/1.png"
              alt="Creating the repository"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that you&#39;ve created the repository you&#39;ll want to clone
            it to your local machine with the following command:
          </p>
          <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git</code></pre>
          <p>
            <em
              >If you don&#39;t have <code>git</code> installed you can follow
              the instructions
              <a
                href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"
                >here</a
              >
              to install it.</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>Now we can move on to actually creating the website.</p>
          <h2 id="website-creation">Website Creation</h2>
          <p>
            You can write your own HTML and CSS to create your website however,
            for the purposes of this tutorial I&#39;ll be using a template from
            <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5Up</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5Up</a> is a place where you can
            download and use premade HTML5 website templates for your own
            purposes completely for free.
          </p>
          <p>
            After choosing and downloading your template, I&#39;ll be using the
            <a href="https://html5up.net/aerial/download">Aerial</a> theme,
            you&#39;ll want to unzip the contents of the file to the GitHub
            directory you just cloned onto your machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/2.png"
              alt="Unzipped website contents"
            />
          </p>
          <p>Now your repository should look something like the following:</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io/
├── assets/
├── index.html
├── LICENSE.txt
└── README.txt</code></pre>
          <p>
            You can go ahead and customize the HTML and CSS files to your liking
            but for this tutorial I&#39;ll just leave them as is.
          </p>
          <h2 id="uploading-your-files-to-your-repository">
            Uploading Your Files to Your Repository
          </h2>
          <p>
            You&#39;re almost done! Now you need to push your changes up to your
            GitHub repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            To push your changes to your repository you&#39;ll want to use
            either the
            <a
              href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line"
              >command line</a
            >
            or <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> which is
            a GUI interface for working with GitHub repositories.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the sake of simplicity I&#39;ll use GitHub Desktop to push the
            changes to my repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon launching GitHub Desktop you&#39;ll want to sign in and towards
            the top left of the application under the &quot;File&quot; option,
            you&#39;ll want to click on &quot;Add local repository&quot; and
            choose the repository you just cloned to your machine not too long
            ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/3.png"
              alt="Adding a local repository"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Next you&#39;ll want to commit your changes to your main branch by
            clicking the blue button towards the bottom left side.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/4.png"
              alt="Commiting changes to the remote repository"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Great! Finally, you&#39;ll want to publish your branch by clicking
            on the &quot;Publish branch&quot; button towards the top left side
            of the application so your changes appear on GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/5.png"
              alt="Pushing changes to GitHub"
            />
          </p>
          <h2 id="checking-your-website">Checking Your Website</h2>
          <p>Now you should be done! Congrats!</p>
          <p>
            GitHub should be smart enough to publish your website automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make sure our website is live, go to the repository on GitHub and
            under the &quot;Settings&quot; tab, go to the &quot;Pages&quot;
            section.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/6.png"
              alt="Seeing your website live"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don&#39;t see a green alert box saying your website is
            published (i.e. it&#39;s still a blue alert box) you just have to
            wait.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a couple of minutes, GitHub should publish your website
            automatically at the following address:
          </p>
          <pre><code>https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code></pre>
          <p>
            If for some reason GitHub didn&#39;t detect your page automatically,
            you&#39;ll simply want to update the branch GitHub pages is pointing
            to. You have to make sure it points to the <code>main</code> branch
            and the <code>root</code> folder.
          </p>
          <p>

              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/7.png"
              alt="Changing GitHub Pages Branch and Folder"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Congratulations, you have now published your very first website!
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/8.png"
              alt="Live website"
            />
          </p>
          <h2 id="optional-custom-domain-name">Optional: Custom Domain Name</h2>
          <p>
            As an optional step, I&#39;ll be showing you how to add a custom
            domain to your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            First you&#39;ll want to buy your domain. My go to place for buying
            domains is
            <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">NameCheap</a> but you can use
            any domain provider.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you&#39;ve bought your domain, you&#39;ll want to configure
            your domain provider&#39;s DNS settings to point to the GitHub
            servers by adding the following four IP addresses as
            <code>A Record</code>&#39;s:
          </p>
          <pre><code>185.199.108.153</code></pre>
          <pre><code>185.199.109.153</code></pre>
          <pre><code>185.199.110.153</code></pre>
          <pre><code>185.199.111.153</code></pre>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/9.png"
              alt="Domain DNS settings"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Next you&#39;ll want to create a <code>CNAME</code> and make sure it
            points to your GitHub website like so:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/10.png"
              alt="CNAME"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Now head over to the local GitHub repository you cloned and add a
            file called
            <code>CNAME</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Make sure it doesn&#39;t have a file extension and it&#39;s just
              the name <code>CNAME</code>.</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/11.png"
              alt="CNAME"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Now inside of <code>CNAME</code> add the name of the domain you just
            purchased.
          </p>
          <pre><code>mydomain.com</code></pre>
          <p>
            Then you want to go to GitHub Desktop and commit and publish your
            changes just like we did when we initially published our website.
          </p>
          <p>You&#39;re almost done!</p>
          <p>
            Finally you&#39;ll want to head over to your repository on GitHub
            and under the Settings tab in the Pages section, make sure that the
            custom domain listed is the one you wrote in the
            <code>CNAME</code> file.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/creating-your-own-website/12.png"
              alt="CNAME"
            />
          </p>
          <p>Congratulations! Now you have a website with a custom domain!</p>
          <p>
            If you&#39;re still unsure or are stuck in adding a custom domain to
            your website you can go
            <a
              href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site"
              >here</a
            >
            for a more detailed explanation.
