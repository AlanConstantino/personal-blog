            I'd like to point out that I am by no means an expert in
            electronics. If you were to ask me to make a circuit diagram or
            explain the minutiae of how a certain electronic piece works, I'd
            draw a complete blank. In reality, I completed this project by just
            tinkering around with electronic components and having a basic
            understanding of how electricity works. That being said, you should
            always exercise caution when working with electronics, especially
            when using external power sources.

            I suck at taking care of plants, mostly because I forget to water
            them. So then I started thinking, "I'm sure someone out there has
            figured out a way to automate this process." Turns out, there are
            plenty of people who have. Namely in the form of using an Arduino or
            a Raspberry Pi to automatically water their plants. In this post,
            I'll be talking about how I used a Raspberry Pi and Python to
            automatically water my plant.

            Once I had all the components I needed, it was time to do some
            research. The following are the resources I used to hookup the

          <p>Here is an image of the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi:</p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/rpi-plant-article/gpio-pins.png"
              alt="GPIO pins on the raspberry pi"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            First, I started out by hooking up the relay to the Raspberry Pi
            like so:
          </p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/rpi-plant-article/relay-to-rpi.jpg"
              alt="Relay wiring to Raspberry Pi"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            The red wire (female to female) leads from the JD_VCC pin on the
            relay board to the 5V pin (pin 2) on the Raspberry Pi. The orange
            wire (female to female) leads from the VCC pin on the relay board to
            the 3.3V pin (pin 1) on the Raspberry Pi.
          </p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/rpi-plant-article/relay-closeup-2.jpg"
              alt="Close up of JD_VCC and VCC pins on relay"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            By hooking up these wires, we are giving the relay board power. To
            actually control an individual relay, we need to connect two more
            pins from the relay board to the Raspberry Pi, the GND (ground) pin
            and the IN1 pin.
          </p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/rpi-plant-article/relay-closeup.jpg"
              alt="Close up of GND and IN1 pins on relay"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            The black wire (female to female) is the ground wire and that leads
            from the GND pin on the relay board to any ground pin on the
            Raspberry Pi (I used pin 34). The white wire (female to female)
            leads from the IN1 pin on the relay board to pin 12 on the Raspberry
            Pi. The white wire is what will allow us to turn on and off the
            relay with code.
          </p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"

              alt="Pin connections on Raspberry Pi"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            You can wire up the relay and Raspberry Pi however you wish but just
            remember to change the pin numbers if you use the code I provide.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the relay board and the Raspberry Pi are wired up, I then
            proceeded to connect the 12V adapter to the individual relay.
            <b
              >DON'T CONNECT THE 12V WALL ADAPTER INTO A WALL OUTLET UNTIL AFTER
              YOU FINISH WIRING UP EVERYTHING, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WORKING WITH
              LIVE POWER.</b
            >
          </p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"

              alt="12V adapter wiring"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            The 12V power supply comes with a handy adapter that you can use to
            connect wires. I wired up the red wire (male to male) to the + sign
            of the adapter and the brown wire (male to male) to the - sign of
            the adapter. I then added an alligator clip (female to male) to the
            brown wire.
          </p>

            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            The relay board has four individual relays and each relay has three
            outputs where you can screw in wires. The output in the middle is
            where you want to connect the positive lead of an external power
            supply while the output to the left of that is where you want to
            connect the positive lead of the device you want to power. This is
            the same for all of the individual relays on the board.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            From the 12v adapter, I hooked up the red wire (positive/power) to
            the relay output in the middle. I then hooked up a new orange wire
            (male to male) to the leftmost output on the relay and attached an
            alligator clip (female to male) to the end of the orange wire.
          </p>

            Now we just need to connect the alligator clips to the water pump.
            It doesn't matter in which order you connect the alligator clips to
            the pump, all you're doing is just setting the water flow.
          </p>

          <p>
            The way I set up my water pump, I wanted water to flow from left to
            right so I connected the black alligator clip to the pin that has a
            red dot next to it and I connected the other alligator clip to the
            other pin on the pump. If I were to reverse the way in which the
            alligator clips are connected, the water would flow would be from
            right to left.
          </p>

            Finally, we come to the part I'm actually good at, the code. To
            interface with the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, I used the
            <a
              href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html"
              class="underline"
              target="_blank"
              >gpiozero library</a
            >. It's really easy to use and abstracts away a lot of the
            lower-level operations you'd usually need to learn in order to get
            started interfacing with the GPIO pins. You can find a link to the
            documentation
            <a
              href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html"
              class="underline"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before we can actually get started writing code, you have to hook up
            your Pi to a monitor, mouse, and keyboard or you can
            <a
              href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/"
              class="underline"
              target="_blank"
              >SSH into your Pi</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you have logged into your Pi, navigate to your Desktop and
            create a folder called "run." Inside of "run," you'll have another
            folder called "classes." Now within the "classes" folder, create a
            file called "Hardware.py" which should look something like this:
          </p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/AlanConstantino/fc7d5f1bbfa212f0a125900ce48b80de.js"></script>

          <p>
            In this file, I just define a new class called Relay that inherits
            from the class
            <a
              href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_output.html#outputdevice"
              class="underline"
              target="_blank"
              >OutputDevice</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, within the "classes" folder, create a new file called
            "TimeKeeper.py" which should look like the following:
          </p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/AlanConstantino/4a4c9080280d14c387caa6f51b1d67e0.js"></script>

          <p>
            Essentially, the purpose of this class is to keep track of the
            current time and the last time our plant gets watered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both "Harware.py" and "TimeKeeper.py" are in the folder called
            "classes." I then created a new file called "water_plant.py" which I
            placed outside of the "classes" folder.
          </p>

          <p>The file "water_plant.py" looks something like this:</p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/AlanConstantino/3136cb51b65833cc914b73d3b69192a9.js"></script>

          <p>
            You can change the value of the "WATERING_TIME" and
            "SECONDS_TO_WATER" variables to whatever you'd like. The first
            variable determines at what time during the day the plant should
            receive water while the latter determines how long the plant will
            receive water.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also set up email reminders so you receive an email whenever your
            plant gets watered as well as an email every Friday to remind you to
            check your water level. By default, I've disabled these reminders so
            the program doesn't crash on start, but if you want to enable them
            you have to do three things: 1) You have to change lines 26 and 27
            to include your Gmail and password 2) You then have to uncomment
            lines 63, 65, and 68 3) You have to go
            <a
              href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1"
              class="underline"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >, log in with the Gmail you want to receive the reminders on, and
            toggle the switch to "ON" or else you'll receive an error when you
            try and send an email using your Gmail account. It's also important
            to note that the email reminders only work with a Gmail account.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now that all the files are set up, you should have something that
            looks like the following directory tree structure:
          </p>

          <pre><code class="text-left">run
├── classes
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── Hardware.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── TimeKeeper.py
└── water_plant.py
</code></pre>

          <p>
            You can place this "run" folder anywhere on the Raspberry Pi but I
            just decided to keep it on the Desktop.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, instead of SSHing into the Pi or hooking it up to a monitor
            every time we want to run the "water_plant.py" script, I wanted the
            script to run whenever we turn on the Raspberry Pi so that way we
            can turn the Pi off and move it anywhere. Once we turn it on, we
            don't have to SSH into the Pi or connect it to a monitor just to run
            the script. To do this, we need to use the "crontab" command.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you open a terminal window on your Pi, either by hooking it up to
            a monitor or by SSHing into it and you type in the following
            command:
          </p>

          <kbd>sudo crontab -e</kbd>

          <p>You should see something similar to this:</p>

          <figure class="figure">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/rpi-plant-article/pi-terminal.png"
              alt="Terminal window on Raspberry Pi"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            In this file, you're going to append the following code snippet:
          </p>

          <code>@reboot python3 /home/pi/Desktop/run/water_plant.py</code>

          <p>
            Then save it by doing <kbd>CTRL+X</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Y</kbd> &rarr;
            <kbd>Enter</kbd>
          </p>

          <p>
            Essentially, we just told the Pi "Hey whenever you reboot, run the
            python script 'water_plant.py' inside the 'run' folder located on
            our Desktop." If you didn't place the 'run' folder on your Desktop,
            just update the path to wherever you placed your "water_plant.py"
            script.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can view the full code
            <a
              href="https://github.com/AlanConstantino/rpi-plant-project"
              class="underline"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >
            or you can just clone the repository with the following command:
          </p>

          <code
            >git clone
            https://github.com/AlanConstantino/rpi-plant-project.git</code
          >

          <p>
            That's it! Now you should have a working Raspberry Pi that waters
            your plants every 24 hours! It even sends you email reminders every
            time your plant gets watered as well as every Friday reminding you
            to check your water level.
          </p>
