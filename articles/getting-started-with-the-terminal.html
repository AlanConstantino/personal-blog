          <h3 id="before-starting">Before Starting</h3>

          <p>
            While most of the commands I'll be talking about apply to both Mac
            and Linux, this article was written assuming you're using a Mac.
            Therefore, some commands, like the open command, may not work if
            you're using Linux.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, before actually getting started learning commands, it’s useful
            to think of the directories (folders) as a hierarchical tree.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/1.png"
              alt="1.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              The root directory is “/” and inside of “/”, you have the
              following folders: bin, tmp, usr, and src.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            In the illustration above, you can see that the first directory,
            often referred to as the “root” directory, is named “/”. That
            directory (folder) contains other directories such as bin, tmp, usr,
            and src. Those directories can have other directories or files and
            those child directories can have even more directories or files and
            so on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, the illustration above is just an example, it doesn’t
            actually reflect the folders and files that reside in your computer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, what the terminal allows us to do is to traverse and manage the
            directory tree. This is why the terminal is so powerful, it allows
            us to quickly sift through folders and files in an efficient manner
            as well as being able to create, delete, or update a file or
            directory.
          </p>

          <h3 id="opening-your-terminal">Opening Your Terminal</h3>

          <p>
            To open your terminal, use the following shortcut:
            <code class="display-inline">⌘</code> +
            <code class="display-inline">Spacebar</code>. Now type in "Terminal"
            and then press the <code class="display-inline">Enter</code> key.
          </p>

          <p>Now, you should have something on your screen that looks like</p>

          <figure>
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/2.png"
              alt="2.png"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            For the most part, you should be staring at a black window with
            white text and a cursor itching for your next command.
          </p>

          <h3 id="important-notes">Important Notes</h3>

          <p>
            It’s important to note that every directory on Mac/UNIX/LINUX has
            two hidden directories, namely “.” and “..”
          </p>

          <p>
            The “.” means the current directory and “..” means previous or
            parent directory. Keep this in mind, it will be useful later.
          </p>

          <p class="oblique">
            Don't worry if you don't understand what the commands in the
            following screenshots do quite yet, just take note of the tab and
            arrow key functionality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another thing, when you type a command, path, or filename, you can
            use "tab" to auto-complete the name.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/tab-auto-complete.gif"
              alt="tab-auto-complete.gif"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">Tab auto-completion.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            You can also cycle through your previous commands with the arrow ↑
            and arrow↓ keys. In addition, you can use the arrow ← or arrow → to
            move the cursor.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/up-down-left-right.gif"
              alt="up-down-left-right.gif"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">Arrow key functionality.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Now, the actual program you will be interacting with is called the
            shell.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following doesn't affect the commands we'll be going over but if
            you plan on writing shell scripts, make a note of which shell you
            are going to use. There are many shells but the most common one is
            BASH (Bourne-Again SHell). This used to be the standard for Apple
            but now they have upgraded to ZSH (Z-SHell).
          </p>

          <h3 id="commands">Commands</h3>

          <p>
            Now that we have a terminal window in front of us, it’s finally time
            to get to the commands.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first command you should type into the terminal should be the
            pwd (print working directory) command.
          </p>

          <h5 id="pwd">pwd — print working directory</h5>

          <code>pwd</code>

          <p>
            This command prints the current directory you’re in onto the
            terminal.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/3.png"
              alt="3.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              Currently in the “/Users/alanjc” directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Congratulations, you just ran your first command on the terminal!
          </p>

          <p>
            This command is useful for knowing where you currently are within
            the directory tree.
          </p>

          <p>The next command we should try is ls or list.</p>

          <h5 id="ls">ls - list</h5>

          <code>ls</code>

          <p>
            This command lists all the directories and files from your current
            directory.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/4.png"
              alt="4.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              By typing ls, we can see all of the files and directories within
              the current directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Cool, now we can list all of the files and directories from our
            current directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            But what if we want to list all the contents from another directory?
          </p>

          <p>Simple, just type the following command:</p>

          <code class="display-inline-block-margin-botttom"
            >ls [directory name]</code
          >

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/5.png"
              alt="5.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We list all the files and folders inside of the “Desktop”
              directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Now we can list files and folders from our current directory or
            other directories.
          </p>

          <p>We can also list hidden files with the "-a" option:</p>

          <code>ls -a</code>

          <p>
            All the "-a" option means is to show all files including the ones
            that start with the "." prefix also known as hidden files.
          </p>

          <p>
            A hidden file or directory is just like a normal file or directory
            except it starts with the "." prefix and is hidden from the user.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's also important to keep in mind that most, if not all commands
            can have options and there are different options for every command.
            You can also have multiple options in one command.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, notice in the following screenshot how just doing the ls
            command doesn't show hidden files but when we add the "-a" option,
            it will list everything including hidden files.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/hidden-files.png"
              alt="hidden-files.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              Listing hidden files with the "-a" option.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            As you can see, in the directory named "example" we have a hidden
            file named ".myfile.txt" and a hidden directory named
            ".mydirectory."
          </p>

          <p>
            As you may recall from earlier, "." means our current directory and
            ".." means our parent directory. Every folder within your
            Mac/UNIX/Linux machine contains these two extra hidden files.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moving on from the ls command, what if we want to change our current
            directory? That's where the cd or change directory command comes
            into play.
          </p>

          <h5 id="cd">cd — change directory</h5>

          <code>cd [directory name]</code>

          <p>
            The cd command allows you to change your directory to another
            directory. This is how you’ll actually traverse the directory tree.
          </p>

          <p>Example:</p>

          <code>cd /</code>

          <p>
            The command above changes your current working directory to your
            root directory.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/6.png"
              alt="6.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              “cd /” changes your current directory to your root directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Another useful cd command to keep in mind is</p>

          <code>cd ~</code>

          <p>
            which changes your current directory to your home directory like so:
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/cd ~.png"
              alt="cd ~.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We are now in the home directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Now, how do we back out of a directory or go to the previous/parent
            directory?
          </p>

          <p>We have to use the following command:</p>

          <code>cd ..</code>

          <p>
            As I mentioned earlier, the “..” means the parent directory or
            previous directory. Effectively, the command above is telling the
            terminal “Hey, take me back to the previous directory.”
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/7.png"
              alt="7.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              Changed directory from “/Users/alanjc/Desktop” to “/Users/alanjc.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Also, if you use this command in the root directory, nothing happens
            because there isn’t a previous or parent directory to go back to,
            hence the name root.
          </p>

          <p>But what if you want to go back more than one directory?</p>

          <p>No problem, the following command is just what you need.</p>

          <code>cd ../../</code>

          <p>
            The command above tells the terminal “Hey, I want to go back two
            directories and make it snappy.” Okay, maybe not so much the snappy
            part, but it does take you back two directories.
          </p>

          <p>Essentially, every “../” you add takes you back one directory.</p>

          <p>So the following example will take you back three directories:</p>

          <code>cd ../../../</code>

          <p>Finally, another useful-to-know "cd" command is</p>

          <code>cd -</code>

          <p>
            With the above command, you'll return to your previous working
            directory.
          </p>

          <p>So for example, let's say I was in the</p>

          <code>/Users/alanjc/Desktop/</code>

          <p>directory. Then I navigate to</p>

          <code>/Users/alanjc/Desktop/myFolder/anotherFolder/</code>

          <p>If I do the "cd -" command, I'll be back at</p>

          <code>/Users/alanjc/Desktop/</code>

          <p>If I type in the "cd -" command once more, I'll be at the</p>

          <code>/Users/alanjc/Desktop/myFolder/anotherFolder/</code>

          <p>
            Now that we know how to traverse the directory tree and list its
            contents, we should move onto more useful commands.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before that though, we should probably clear our terminal screen
            because by now it may be a little tough to read.
          </p>

          <h5 id="clear">clear</h5>

          <p>
            By typing in the following command into the terminal, you are able
            to clear what’s on screen.
          </p>

          <code class="display-inline-block-margin-botttom">clear</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/8.gif"
              alt="8.gif"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">Clearing the terminal.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Now that our screen has been cleared, we can move onto more useful
            commands, like the mv (move) command.
          </p>

          <h5 id="mv">mv - move</h5>

          <code>mv [source] [destination]</code>

          <p>
            The mv (move) command has two uses, the first is just as the name
            implies, you can move things from one place to another. The second
            use is for renaming a file.
          </p>

          <p>Lets' take a look at the former.</p>

          <p>
            From the skeleton command above, the “source” is what you want to
            move while the “destination” is where you want the file to end up.
          </p>

          <p>For example, if I have something like the following:</p>

          <pre><code class="text-left">one
├── myfile.txt
└── two
</code></pre>

          <p>
            Where “one” and “two” are folders, and I want to move, “myfile.txt”
            to folder “two” I would simply do the following assuming I was
            already in the “one” folder location:
          </p>

          <code>mv myfile.txt two</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/9.png"
              alt="9.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We moved “myfile.txt” to the folder “two.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Of course, you could be anywhere in the directory tree to execute
            this command — and pretty much any command for that matter — but you
            just have to make sure you enter the full location path of the file
            you want to move and its destination.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, in the following screenshot, I’m in my root directory
            but I’m still able to move a file from my Desktop to the “two”
            folder from the previous example:
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/10.png"
              alt="10.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We moved “anotherfile.txt” to the “two” folder while in the root
              directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Now, what if we wanted to move a file or folder from wherever it is
            to our current location in the directory tree.
          </p>

          <p>
            Well, remember earlier how I talked about the “.” being our current
            directory, we would have to use “.”
          </p>

          <p>For example:</p>

          <code>mv /somelocation/myfile.txt .</code>

          <p>
            The example above moves “myfile.txt” to wherever we currently are in
            the directory tree.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now let's take a quick look at the second use of the mv command
            which is for renaming files.
          </p>

          <p>To rename a file, you can do the following:</p>

          <code>mv [old file name] [new file name]</code>

          <p>
            So if I have a file called "myfile.txt" and I want to rename it to
            something else, I would do the following:
          </p>

          <code>mv myfile.txt newname.txt</code>

          <p>And that's it! Now "myfile.txt" gets renamed to "newname.txt."</p>

          <p>Another command that’s similar to mv (move) is cp (copy).</p>

          <h5 id="cp">cp — copy</h5>

          <code>cp [source] [destination]</code>

          <p>
            The copy command is just like the move command except instead of
            moving a file or folder, it makes a copy of it leaving the original
            file unharmed.
          </p>

          <p>To copy a file you would do the following:</p>

          <code>cp myfile.txt /one</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/11.png"
              alt="11.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We copied “myfile.txt” to the “one” folder.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Now to copy a directory you have to add the “-r” option like so:
          </p>

          <code>cp -r one two</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/12.png"
              alt="12.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We copy the contents of the “one” directory into the “two”
              directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            All the “-r” option means is that it tells the terminal to copy the
            files recursively which is a fancy way of saying everything.
          </p>

          <p>
            So by using the “-r” option, we tell the terminal “Please copy all
            the contents, including folders and files to our destination.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, what if we wanted to open a file or folder from our terminal?
          </p>

          <p>We would need to utilize the open command.</p>

          <h5 id="open">open</h5>

          <p class="oblique">
            Note: The Linux equivalent of this command seems to be "xdg-open"
            but this may differ from distro to distro.
          </p>

          <code>open [file/folder]</code>

          <p>This command lets us open a file with its associated program.</p>

          <p>
            For example, if we have a “.txt” file and we do the following
            command:
          </p>

          <code>open myfile.txt</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/13.png"
              alt="13.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We open a file named “myfile.txt.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>this opens “myfile.txt” with your default text editor like so:</p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/14.png"
              alt="14.png"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>Here’s another example.</p>

          <p>
            If you do the following command, it will open the finder window in
            the root directory.
          </p>

          <code>open /</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/15.png"
              alt="15.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We opened a new finder window at the root directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>The finder window will look something like the following:</p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/16.png"
              alt="16.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              A finder window showing the contents of the root directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            It opens the finder window because that’s the program that is
            associated with the file or in this case the folder you’re trying to
            open.
          </p>

          <p>So if we did the following command:</p>

          <code>open .</code>

          <p>
            it would open a new finder window from our current location because
            remember, the “.” means our current directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, let’s move onto actually making a directory from the terminal.
          </p>

          <h5 id="mkdir">mkdir — make directory</h5>

          <code>mkdir [directory name]</code>

          <p>
            To make a directory, you simply type the command above and give it a
            name like so:
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/17.png"
              alt="17.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We made a directory named “mydirectory.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>We can also create multiple directories like so:</p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/18.png"
              alt="18.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We created two directories, one named “newdirectory” and another
              named “anotherdirectory.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>What if we wanted to make a file instead of a directory?</p>

          <p>We would use the touch command.</p>

          <h5 id="touch">touch</h5>

          <code>touch [file name]</code>

          <p>
            This command has two uses but I'll only talk about its main use and
            mention the second.
          </p>

          <p>Its main use is for creating an empty file.</p>

          <p>
            Its other use is for updating timestamps of a file but we won't get
            into that for the sake of simplicity.
          </p>

          <p>So if we do the following:</p>

          <code>touch myfile.txt</code>

          <p>
            This creates a file named “myfile.txt” in our current directory.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/19.png"
              alt="19.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We create a file named “myfile.txt.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            And similar to mkdir, you can create multiple files in one command
            like so:
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/20.png"
              alt="20.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We create “myfile.txt” in the current directory and
              “anotherone.txt” in the previous directory.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            In the screenshot above, we create two files, “myfile.txt” and
            “anotherone.txt.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The “myfile.txt” file is created in the current directory while the
            “anotherone.txt” file is created in the previous directory.
          </p>

          <p>Let’s move on to deleting a directory.</p>

          <h5 id="rmdir">rmdir — remove directory</h5>

          <code>rmdir [directory name]</code>

          <p>
            The rmdir command is self-explanatory, it just deletes a directory.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/21.png"
              alt="21.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We are deleting an empty directory named “emptydir.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            However, it’s important to note that when using this command, you
            can only remove an empty directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            If your directory is not empty and you try to use the rmdir command,
            you’ll get something like the following:
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/22.png"
              alt="22.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">

              empty.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Now how do we remove the contents of a directory you may be asking?
          </p>

          <p>We would have to use the rm (remove) command.</p>

          <h5 id="rm">rm — remove</h5>

          <code>rm [file name]</code>

          <p>
            This command is probably the most powerful and yet the most
            dangerous one on this list which is why I saved it for last.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you use this command and delete something, it’s gone forever.
          </p>

          <p>
            It doesn’t get put into your Trash for you to empty out later. No!
            Once you type in this command and hit enter, poof… it’s gone…
            forever…
          </p>

          <p>
            This also applies to rmdir, once you remove a directory, it’s gone
            forever.
          </p>

          <p>
            But unlike rmdir, the rm command has the ability to remove both a
            directory as well as a file which makes this command better than
            rmdir.
          </p>

          <p>With this in mind, let’s see it in action.</p>

          <p>To remove a file, simply do the following:</p>

          <code>rm myfile.txt</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/23.png"
              alt="23.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We removed a file named “myfile.txt.”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            And just like some of the previous commands, we can delete multiple
            things at once by using the following format:
          </p>

          <code>rm [file1] [file2] [etc]</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/24.png"
              alt="24.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We delete “afile.txt” and “anotherone.txt”
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            In the example above, we delete “afile.txt” from the current
            directory and subsequently delete “anotherone.txt” from the previous
            or parent directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we wanted to delete only certain files that end in specific
            extensions (i.e. .txt, .png, .exe, etc) we would use the asterisk or
            “*” symbol. This symbol is often referred to as a wildcard.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, if we were in a directory and we only wanted to delete
            .txt files, we would do the following:
          </p>

          <code>rm *.txt</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/25.png"
              alt="25.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We delete various .txt files.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            As you can see, we deleted all the files that end with the “.txt”
            extension. If we had other files such as .png, .gif, etc, those
            files would be unscathed by the rm command.
          </p>

          <p>
            So by using the “*” symbol we effectively tell the terminal to
            disregard the name of the file and only look at the extension of the
            file.
          </p>

          <p>Now let’s get into the danger zone.</p>

          <p>
            Earlier I said that most if not all commands have something called
            options. These options are added right after the command like so:
          </p>

          <code>[command] [options] [other paramters]</code>

          <p>
            Well, the rm command has two options that I’m going to show you
            which are dangerous if used without precaution and quite lethal in
            combination.
          </p>

          <h5>rm -r</h5>

          <p>
            The first is the “-r” option. As you may recall, I said that the
            “-r” option means do it recursively, which is just another way of
            saying all or targeting everything.
          </p>

          <p>If you do the following command:</p>

          <code>rm -r [directory]</code>

          <p>
            it will delete everything inside of a directory including the folder
            itself.
          </p>

          <p>So if I have the following directory:</p>

          <pre><code class="text-left">newfolder
├── folder1
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── text1.txt
├── folder2
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── text2.txt
└── folder3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── text3.txt</code></pre>

          <p>and then I input the following command:</p>

          <code>rm -r newfolder</code>

          <p>
            It will delete everything within the “newfolder” directory as well
            as the folder itself.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/26.png"
              alt="26.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We delete all of the contents of the “newfolder” directory
              including the folder itself.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p class="oblique">
            As a side note, the ‘tree’ command isn’t available by default on
            Mac, you have to download and install it seperately.
          </p>

          <p>Now we move onto the other option, “-f.”</p>

          <h5>rm -f</h5>

          <code>rm -f [file/directory]</code>

          <p>
            Sometimes, when you use the rm command, you may get a prompt. This
            prompt may just be something like “Are you sure you want to delete
            the following file or directory?”
          </p>

          <p>
            By using this option, you avoid having the prompt show up in the
            first place.
          </p>

          <p>
            Essentially, this just tells the terminal, “Delete the following
            file/directory and don’t give me a prompt.”
          </p>

          <p>Now we move onto the most lethal combination, “-rf.”</p>

          <h5>rm -rf</h5>

          <code>rm -rf [directory]</code>

          <p>
            When you combine both the “r” and the “f” options, you’re telling
            the terminal “Delete all of the contents of the directory and don’t
            show me a prompt, capeesh.”
          </p>

          <p>As you can probably guess, this is quite dangerous.</p>

          <p>
            No need to fret though, as long as you’re cautious and don’t use
            this command on let’s say, you’re root directory, you should—for the
            most part—be fine.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's also important to note that on Linux if you run this command on
            your root directory, it'll remove it without a moment's hesitation.
          </p>

          <p>
            You won't get a prompt or a warning saying "Hey my dude, are you
            sure you want to delete your root directory?" No! Instead, Linux
            will just be like "Okay sure, say no more" and will go ahead and
            delete everything inside your root directory essentially destroying
            your system.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alright, so now that we know what the “r” and “f” options do, let’s
            run through an example.
          </p>

          <p>Here I have a directory which looks something like this:</p>

          <pre><code>anotherfolder
└── myfolder
├── folder1
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── file1.txt
├── folder2
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── file2.txt
├── folder3
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── file3.txt
└── folder4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── file4.txt
</code>
          </pre>

          <p>
            Now if I run the following command (assuming I’m already at the
            “anotherfolder” location):
          </p>

          <code>rm -rf myfolder</code>

          <p>
            It should delete all the contents inside the “myfolder” directory
            including the folder itself and I shouldn’t see any prompts.
          </p>

          <p>All right, let’s give it a shot.</p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/27.png"
              alt="27.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              We remove all the contents of “myfolder” including the folder
              itself.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Sure enough, it worked.</p>

          <p>
            Finally, I want to talk about one more useful command called man or
            manual.
          </p>

          <h5 id="man">man - manual</h5>

          <code>man [command name]</code>

          <p>
            This command lets you look up what other commands do. So let's say
            for some reason you remember a command but forget what it does, you
            can use man to look up its functionality.
          </p>

          <p>For example, if I forgot what mv did, I would do the following:</p>

          <code class="display-inline-block-margin-botttom">man mv</code>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/man mv.png"
              alt="man mv.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              The functionality for the mv command.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            You can use the arrow ↑ or arrow↓ keys on your keyboard to read
            through its functionality and once you're done you can press "Q" to
            quit and return back to your previous page.
          </p>

          <p>
            The man commands also gives you a list of options associated with
            the command you looked up like so:
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img
              class="u-max-full-width"
              src="../images/terminal-article/man mv options.png"
              alt="man mv options.png"
            />
            <figcaption class="oblique">
              The options associated with the mv command.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Now let’s recap what we learned.</p>

          <h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

          <p>
            It’s useful to think of directories as a hierarchical tree with the
            topmost directory being the root directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            The “.” means current directory while “..” means previous or parent
            directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            The actual program you are interacting with is called the shell.
          </p>

          <p>You can use tab to autocomplete commands, paths, or file names.</p>

          <p>
            You can also use the arrow ↑ and arrow↓ keys to cycle through
            previous commands as well as the arrow ← or arrow → to move the
            cursor.
          </p>

          <p>We also took a look at the following commands:</p>

          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>pwd</code> prints the current working directory
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>ls</code> lists all the contents of the current directory
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>cd [directory name]</code> changes directory
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>clear</code> clears the terminal screen
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>mv [source] [destination]</code> moves files or folders from
              one place to another and can rename files or folders
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>cp [source] [destination]</code> copies files or folders
              from one place to another
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>open [file/directory]</code> opens the file or folder with
              the associated program

              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="oblique list-group-item">
                  "xdg-open" is the equivalent on Linux.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>mkdir [directory name]</code> makes a new empty directory
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>touch [file name]</code> creates a new empty file with the
              name of your choice and can update a file's timestamps
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>rmdir [empty directory]</code> removes an empty directory
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>rm [file name]</code> removes a file
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>rm -rf [directory name]</code> removes the folder and its
              contents without showing any prompts
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>man [command name]</code> brings up the manual for the given
              command
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>And this is only scratching the surface of the terminal.</p>

          <p>
            There are many more useful commands but these are just the basics to
            get you up and running.
          </p>

          <h3 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to Go From Here?</h3>

          <p>
            If you want to learn more about the commands we went over, I highly
            suggest you look up every command we talked about using man,
            including the man command itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition here are some other commands that I didn't go over but
            are just as useful:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>cat</code> concatenates and prints files to the terminal
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>less</code> displays contents of a file
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>grep</code> searches files for a certain word or regular
              expression

              <code>ls -l</code> lists files in long format
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>kill</code> can terminate a signal or process
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>chmod</code> allows you to change or modify access
              permissions of a file or folder

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>sudo</code> a prefix that allows you to run commands as a

            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <code>mkdir</code> you can create multiple directories within the
