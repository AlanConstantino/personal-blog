                            So, you want to learn how to use the Terminal. Great! As a developer, sooner or later,
                            you’ll want to learn how to use the Terminal. Not only is this a handy tool to have under
                            your belt, but it will also boost your productivity.

                        <p>
                            While most of the commands I'll be talking about apply to both Mac and Linux, this article
                            was written assuming you're using a Mac. Therefore, some commands, like the open command,
                            may not work if you're using Linux.
                        </p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>
                            Now, before actually getting started learning commands, it’s useful to think of the
                            directories (folders) as a hierarchical tree.
                        </p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/1.png" alt="1.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">The root directory is “/” and inside of “/”, you have the
                                following folders: bin, tmp, usr, and src.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            In the illustration above, you can see that the first directory, often referred to as the
                            “root” directory, is named “/”. That directory (folder) contains other directories such as
                            bin, tmp, usr, and src. Those directories can have other directories or files and those
                            child directories can have even more directories or files and so on.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Of course, the illustration above is just an example, it doesn’t actually reflect the
                            folders and files that reside in your computer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, what the terminal allows us to do is to traverse and manage the directory tree. This is
                            why the terminal is so powerful, it allows us to quickly sift through folders and files in
                            an efficient manner as well as being able to create, delete, or update a file or directory.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="opening-your-terminal">Opening Your Terminal</h3>

                        <p>
                            To open your terminal, use the following shortcut: <kbd class="display-inline">⌘</kbd> +
                            <kbd class="display-inline">Spacebar</kbd>. Now type in "Terminal" and then press the
                            <kbd class="display-inline">Enter</kbd> key.
                        </p>

                        <p>Now, you should have something on your screen that looks like</p>

                        <p>
                            For the most part, you should be staring at a black window with white text and a cursor
                            itching for your next command.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="important-notes">Important Notes</h3>

                        <p>
                            It’s important to note that every directory on Mac/UNIX/LINUX has two hidden directories,
                            namely “.” and “..”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The “.” means the current directory and “..” means previous or parent directory. Keep this
                            in mind, it will be useful later.
                        </p>

                            Another thing, when you type a command, path, or filename, you can use "tab" to

                            The following doesn't affect the commands we'll be going over but if you plan on writing
                            shell scripts, make a note of which shell you are going to use. There are many shells but
                            the most common one is BASH (Bourne-Again SHell). This used to be the standard for Apple but
                            now they have upgraded to ZSH (Z-SHell).

                            Now that we have a terminal window in front of us, it’s finally time to get to the commands.

                        <p>
                            The first command you should type into the terminal should be the pwd (print working
                            directory) command.
                        </p>

                        <kbd>pwd</kbd>

                        <p>This command prints the current directory you’re in onto the terminal.</p>

                        <p>This command is useful for knowing where you currently are within the directory tree.</p>

                        <p>The next command we should try is ls or list.</p>

                        <h5 id="ls">ls - list</h5>

                        <kbd>ls</kbd>

                            A hidden file or directory is just like a normal file or directory except it starts with the
                            "." prefix and is hidden from the user.

                            It's also important to keep in mind that most, if not all commands can have options and
                            there are different options for every command. You can also have multiple options in one
                            command.

                            Now, notice in the following screenshot how just doing the ls command doesn't show hidden
                            files but when we add the "-a" option, it will list everything including hidden files.

                            As you can see, in the directory named "example" we have a hidden file named ".myfile.txt"

                            As you may recall from earlier, "." means our current directory and ".." means our parent
                            directory. Every folder within your Mac/UNIX/Linux machine contains these two extra hidden
                            files.

                            Moving on from the ls command, what if we want to change our current directory? That's where
                            the cd or change directory command comes into play.
                        </p>

                        <h5 id="cd">cd — change directory</h5>

                        <kbd>cd [directory name]</kbd>

                        <p>
                            The cd command allows you to change your directory to another directory. This is how you’ll
                            actually traverse the directory tree.
                        </p>

                        <p>Example:</p>

                        <kbd>cd /</kbd>

                        <p>The command above changes your current working directory to your root directory.</p>

                        <p>Now, how do we back out of a directory or go to the previous/parent directory?</p>

                        <p>We have to use the following command:</p>

                        <kbd>cd ..</kbd>

                        <p>
                            As I mentioned earlier, the “..” means the parent directory or previous directory.
                            Effectively, the command above is telling the terminal “Hey, take me back to the previous
                            directory.”
                        </p>

                        <figure class="text-center">

                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            Also, if you use this command in the root directory, nothing happens because there isn’t a
                            previous or parent directory to go back to, hence the name root.
                        </p>

                        <p>But what if you want to go back more than one directory?</p>

                        <p>No problem, the following command is just what you need.</p>

                        <kbd>cd ../../</kbd>

                        <p>
                            The command above tells the terminal “Hey, I want to go back two directories and make it
                            snappy.” Okay, maybe not so much the snappy part, but it does take you back two directories.
                        </p>

                        <p>Essentially, every “../” you add takes you back one directory.</p>

                        <p>So the following example will take you back three directories:</p>

                        <kbd>cd ../../../</kbd>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>Finally, another useful-to-know "cd" command is</p>

                            Now that we know how to traverse the directory tree and list its contents, we should move
                            onto more useful commands.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before that though, we should probably clear our terminal screen because by now it may be a
                            little tough to read.

                            Now that our screen has been cleared, we can move onto more useful commands, like the mv
                            (move) command.

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>
                            The mv (move) command has two uses, the first is just as the name implies, you can move
                            things from one place to another. The second use is for renaming a file.
                        </p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>Lets' take a look at the former.</p>

                        <!-- Delete -->
                        <!-- <p>The mv (move) command simply moves a file or directory to another place.</p> -->

                        <p>
                            From the skeleton command above, the “source” is what you want to move while the
                            “destination” is where you want the file to end up.
                        </p>

                        <p>For example, if I have something like the following:</p>

                        <code class="text-left">
                            one<br>

                            └── two
                        </code>

                        <p>
                            Where “one” and “two” are folders, and I want to move, “myfile.txt” to folder “two” I would
                            simply do the following assuming I was already in the “one” folder location:
                        </p>

                        <kbd>mv myfile.txt two</kbd>

                            Of course, you could be anywhere in the directory tree to execute this command — and pretty
                            much any command for that matter — but you just have to make sure you enter the full
                            location path of the file you want to move and its destination.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, in the following screenshot, I’m in my root directory but I’m still able to
                            move a file from my Desktop to the “two” folder from the previous example:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, what if we wanted to move a file or folder from wherever it is to our current location
                            in the directory tree.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Well, remember earlier how I talked about the “.” being our current directory, we would have
                            to use “.”
                        </p>

                        <p>For example:</p>

                        <kbd>mv /somelocation/myfile.txt .</kbd>

                        <p>The example above moves “myfile.txt” to wherever we currently are in the directory tree.</p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>
                            Now let's take a quick look at the second use of the mv command which is for renaming files.
                        </p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>To rename a file, you can do the following:</p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <kbd>mv [old file name] [new file name]</kbd>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>
                            So if I have a file called "myfile.txt" and I want to rename it to something else, I would
                            do the following:
                        </p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <kbd>mv myfile.txt newname.txt</kbd>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>And that's it! Now "myfile.txt" gets renamed to "newname.txt."</p>

                        <p>Another command that’s similar to mv (move) is cp (copy).</p>

                        <h5 id="cp">cp — copy</h5>

                        <kbd>cp [source] [destination]</kbd>

                        <p>
                            The copy command is just like the move command except instead of moving a file or folder, it
                            makes a copy of it leaving the original file unharmed.
                        </p>

                        <p>To copy a file you would do the following:</p>

                        <kbd>cp myfile.txt /one</kbd>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/11.png" alt="11.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">We copied “myfile.txt” to the “one” folder.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>Now to copy a directory you have to add the “-r” option like so:</p>

                        <kbd>cp -r one two</kbd>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/12.png" alt="12.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">
                                We copy the contents of the “one” directory into the “two” directory.

                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            All the “-r” option means is that it tells the terminal to copy the files recursively which
                            is a fancy way of saying everything.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So by using the “-r” option, we tell the terminal “Please copy all the contents, including
                            folders and files to our destination.”
                        </p>

                        <!-- Delete -->
                        <!-- <p>
                            It's also important to keep in mind that most, if not all, commands can have options and
                            there are different options for every command. You can also have more than one option.
                        </p> -->

                        <p>Now, what if we wanted to open a file or folder from our terminal?</p>

                        <p>We would need to utilize the open command.</p>

                        <h5 id="open">open</h5>

                        <p class="oblique">
                            Note: The Linux equivalent of this command seems to be "xdg-open" but this may differ from
                            distro to distro.
                        </p>

                        <kbd>open [file/folder]</kbd>

                        <p>This command lets us open a file with its associated program.</p>

                        <p>For example, if we have a “.txt” file and we do the following command:</p>

                        <kbd>open myfile.txt</kbd>

                        <figure class="text-center">

                        </figure>

                        <p>this opens “myfile.txt” with your default text editor like so:</p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/14.png" alt="14.png">
                        </figure>

                        <p>Here’s another example.</p>

                        <p>If you do the following command, it will open the finder window in the root directory.</p>

                        <kbd>open /</kbd>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/15.png" alt="15.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">
                                We opened a new finder window at the root directory.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>The finder window will look something like the following:</p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/16.png" alt="16.png">

                                A finder window showing the contents of the root directory.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            It opens the finder window because that’s the program that is associated with the file or in
                            this case the folder you’re trying to open.
                        </p>

                        <p>So if we did the following command:</p>

                        <kbd>open .</kbd>

                        <p>
                            it would open a new finder window from our current location because remember, the “.” means
                            our current directory.
                        </p>

                        <p>Now, let’s move onto actually making a directory from the terminal.</p>

                        <h5 id="mkdir">mkdir — make directory</h5>

                        <kbd>mkdir [directory name]</kbd>

                        <p>To make a directory, you simply type the command above and give it a name like so:</p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/17.png" alt="17.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">We made a directory named “mydirectory.”</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>We can also create multiple directories like so:</p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/18.png" alt="18.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">
                                We created two directories, one named “newdirectory” and another named
                                “anotherdirectory.”
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>What if we wanted to make a file instead of a directory?</p>

                        <p>We would use the touch command.</p>

                        <h5 id="touch">touch</h5>

                        <kbd>touch [file name]</kbd>

                        <!-- Delete -->
                        <!-- <p>This command simply creates an empty file.</p> -->

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>This command has two uses but I'll only talk about its main use and mention the second.</p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>Its main use is for creating an empty file.</p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>
                            Its other use is for updating timestamps of a file but we won't get into that for the sake
                            of simplicity.
                        </p>

                        <p>So if we do the following:</p>

                        <kbd>touch myfile.txt</kbd>

                        <p>This creates a file named “myfile.txt” in our current directory.</p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/19.png" alt="19.png">

                        </figure>

                        <p>And similar to mkdir, you can create multiple files in one command like so:</p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/20.png" alt="20.png">

                                We create “myfile.txt” in the current directory and “anotherone.txt” in the previous

                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>In the screenshot above, we create two files, “myfile.txt” and “anotherone.txt.”</p>

                        <p>
                            The “myfile.txt” file is created in the current directory while the “anotherone.txt” file is
                            created in the previous directory.
                        </p>

                        <p>Let’s move on to deleting a directory.</p>

                        <h5 id="rmdir">rmdir — remove directory</h5>

                        <kbd>rmdir [directory name]</kbd>

                        <p>The rmdir command is self-explanatory, it just deletes a directory.</p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/21.png" alt="21.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">
                                We are deleting an empty directory named “emptydir.”
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            However, it’s important to note that when using this command, you can only remove an empty
                            directory.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If your directory is not empty and you try to use the rmdir command, you’ll get something
                            like the following:
                        </p>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/22.png" alt="22.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">
                                We failed at removing the directory “folder” because it’s not empty.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>Now how do we remove the contents of a directory you may be asking?</p>

                        <p>We would have to use the rm (remove) command.</p>

                        <h5 id="rm">rm — remove</h5>

                        <kbd>rm [file name]</kbd>

                        <p>
                            This command is probably the most powerful and yet the most dangerous one on this list which
                            is why I saved it for last.
                        </p>

                        <p>Once you use this command and delete something, it’s gone forever.</p>

                        <p>
                            It doesn’t get put into your Trash for you to empty out later. No! Once you type in this
                            command and hit enter, poof… it’s gone… forever…
                        </p>

                        <p>This also applies to rmdir, once you remove a directory, it’s gone forever.</p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>
                            But unlike rmdir, the rm command has the ability to remove both a directory as well as a
                            file which makes this command better than rmdir.
                        </p>

                        <p>With this in mind, let’s see it in action.</p>

                        <p>To remove a file, simply do the following:</p>

                        <kbd>rm myfile.txt</kbd>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/23.png" alt="23.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">We removed a file named “myfile.txt.”</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            And just like some of the previous commands, we can delete multiple things at once by using
                            the following format:
                        </p>

                        <kbd>rm [file1] [file2] [etc]</kbd>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/24.png" alt="24.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">We delete “afile.txt” and “anotherone.txt”</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            In the example above, we delete “afile.txt” from the current directory and subsequently
                            delete “anotherone.txt” from the previous or parent directory.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If we wanted to delete only certain files that end in specific extensions (i.e. .txt, .png,
                            .exe, etc) we would use the asterisk or “*” symbol. This symbol is often referred to as a
                            wildcard.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, if we were in a directory and we only wanted to delete .txt files, we would do
                            the following:
                        </p>

                        <kbd>rm *.txt</kbd>

                        <figure class="text-center">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/terminal-article/25.png" alt="25.png">
                            <figcaption class="oblique">We delete various .txt files.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            As you can see, we deleted all the files that end with the “.txt” extension. If we had other
                            files such as .png, .gif, etc, those files would be unscathed by the rm command.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So by using the “*” symbol we effectively tell the terminal to disregard the name of the
                            file and only look at the extension of the file.
                        </p>

                        <p>Now let’s get into the danger zone.</p>

                        <p>
                            Earlier I said that most if not all commands have something called options. These options
                            are added right after the command like so:
                        </p>

                        <kbd>[command] [options] [other paramters]</kbd>

                        <p>
                            Well, the rm command has two options that I’m going to show you which are dangerous if used
                            without precaution and quite lethal in combination.
                        </p>

                        <h5>rm -r</h5>

                        <p>
                            The first is the “-r” option. As you may recall, I said that the “-r” option means do it
                            recursively, which is just another way of saying all or targeting everything.
                        </p>

                        <p>If you do the following command:</p>

                        <kbd>rm -r [directory]</kbd>

                        <p>it will delete everything inside of a directory including the folder itself.</p>

                        <p>So if I have the following directory:</p>

                        <code class="text-left">
                            newfolder<br>

                        <p>and then I input the following command:</p>

                        <kbd>rm -r newfolder</kbd>

                        <p>It will delete everything within the “newfolder” directory as well as the folder itself.</p>

                            As a side note, the ‘tree’ command isn’t available by default on Mac, you have to download
                            and install it seperately.
                        </p>

                        <p>Now we move onto the other option, “-f.”</p>

                        <h5>rm -f</h5>

                        <kbd>rm -f [file/directory]</kbd>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes, when you use the rm command, you may get a prompt. This prompt may just be
                            something like “Are you sure you want to delete the following file or directory?”
                        </p>

                        <p>By using this option, you avoid having the prompt show up in the first place.</p>

                        <p>
                            Essentially, this just tells the terminal, “Delete the following file/directory and don’t
                            give me a prompt.”
                        </p>

                        <p>Now we move onto the most lethal combination, “-rf.”</p>

                        <h5>rm -rf</h5>

                        <kbd>rm -rf [directory]</kbd>

                        <p>
                            When you combine both the “r” and the “f” options, you’re telling the terminal “Delete all
                            of the contents of the directory and don’t show me a prompt, capeesh.”
                        </p>

                        <p>As you can probably guess, this is quite dangerous.</p>

                        <p>
                            No need to fret though, as long as you’re cautious and don’t use this command on let’s say,
                            you’re root directory, you should—for the most part—be fine.

                            It's also important to note that on Linux if you run this command on your root directory,
                            it'll remove it without a moment's hesitation.

                            your root directory?" No! Instead, Linux will just be like "Okay sure, say no more" and will
                            go ahead and delete everything inside your root directory essentially destroying your
                            system.

                            Alright, so now that we know what the “r” and “f” options do, let’s run through an example.
                        </p>

                        <p>Here I have a directory which looks something like this:</p>

                        <code>
                            anotherfolder<br>
                            └── myfolder<br>
                                    ├── folder1<br>
                                    │&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── file1.txt<br>
                                    ├── folder2<br>
                                    │&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── file2.txt<br>
                                    ├── folder3<br>
                                    │&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── file3.txt<br>
                                    └── folder4<br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── file4.txt
                        </code>

                        <p>
                            Now if I run the following command (assuming I’m already at the “anotherfolder” location):
                        </p>

                        <kbd>rm -rf myfolder</kbd>

                        <p>
                            It should delete all the contents inside the “myfolder” directory including the folder
                            itself and I shouldn’t see any prompts.
                        </p>

                        <p>All right, let’s give it a shot.</p>

                        <figure class="text-center">

                        <p>Finally, I want to talk about one more useful command called man or manual.</p>

                        <h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

                        <p>
                            It’s useful to think of directories as a hierarchical tree with the topmost directory being
                            the root directory.
                        </p>

                        <p>The “.” means current directory while “..” means previous or parent directory.</p>

                        <p>The actual program you are interacting with is called the shell.</p>

                        <!-- New -->
                        <p>You can use tab to autocomplete commands, paths, or file names.</p>

                        <p>
                            You can also use the arrow ↑ and arrow↓ keys to cycle through previous commands as well as
                            the arrow ← or arrow → to move the cursor.
                        </p>

                        <p>We also took a look at the following commands:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
